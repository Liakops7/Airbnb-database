# Airbnb-database

Database for storage and exploration data coming from Airbnb. The database consists of a collection of tables and the relationships between them. 
The shape of the base is illustrated in an ER diagram. The creation of the tables is using the input of the data with the \copy command. 
Also created referential foreign key constraints.

In second phase, we add tables Host, Room, Price and make changes in our schema in order to normalize
the form of the database.
